Overview
The "Light-Dark Mode Website" project is designed to showcase the ability to create a responsive website supporting both light and dark modes. The website includes a header with a meaningful title, a paragraph of text, an image, and a custom-created button for toggling between light and dark modes.

Tasks
1. Header
Create a header section at the top of the webpage with a meaningful title that reflects the content or purpose of the website.

2. Paragraph and Image
Include a paragraph of text and an image below the header. Utilize appropriate HTML tags for text and the <img> tag for the image to enhance readability and visual appeal.

3. Custom Button with Div and Span
Design a custom button using a div for the button container and a span for the button text. Position the button in the top right corner of the webpage for a clean and accessible user experience.

4. Light and Dark Mode Switching
Implement JavaScript functionality to enable seamless toggling between light and dark modes when the custom button is clicked. Ensure that the text on the button dynamically changes to reflect the current mode.

5. CSS Styling
Apply appropriate CSS styles to create an aesthetically pleasing and responsive design for the website. Consider styles that enhance the user experience for both light and dark modes, providing a visually appealing and cohesive look.
